                        They BLEW the ROOF off at their
                        last show, once everyone started
                        figuring out they were going. This is
                        still simply the greatest opening of a
                        concert I have EVER witnessed.

                        Every time I see him shred I feel so
                        motivated to get off my couch and
                        hop on my board. He’s so talented! I
                        wish I can ride like him one day so I
                        can really enjoy myself!

                        How can someone be so good!!!
                        You can tell he lives for this and
                        loves to do it every day. Everytime I
                        see him I feel instantly happy! He’s
                        definitely my favorite ever!
